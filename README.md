# Quiz Time!
 
 ## Welcome to my second Portfolio Project!
  For my 2nd project i choose a quizgame. This was a fun way to incorporate my love for philosopy aswell as coding. The user gets to answer 5 random questions out of a 20 question pool. Theres a mainpage where you click the start button to come to the quiz page. All the quotes are more or less famous all from the ancient greeks right up until the 20's century.<br>The goal with this project is to make a fun, challenging quiz for eveyone to enjoy. But also a chance for the user to sit down and really read and grasp what the quotes means (thats why there is no timelimit to answer).

## Technologies Used

 For this project we were allowed to use these three programming languages: 

 - [HTML](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
 - [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
 - [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
<hr>

## Design

### Colour Scheme
* My mentor from [CI](https://codeinstitute.net) gave me the idea for the random gradient linear effect behind the quotes. The background is blueish/grayish and yellow "rose pedal"-template. The letters are classic black except for the quotes themself, they are bonewhite. 

### Typography
* For this pages the fonts are Lato and Playfair Display. Playfair Display for the quotes and Lato for everything els. I choose Lato because of the modern/stylish way it looks and Playfair Display for the quotes because of the more classic look.

### Wireframes
* Wireframeswise i wanted to go with something simple and pragmatic, to focus on the quiz-part itself.

## Testing

* Tested on three diffrent browsers: Edge, Chrome and Firefox.  
* Tested it with dev tools, playing the quiz itself.
* Checked responsiveness (using dev tools) on Desktops, Laptops, Tablets and Mobile. 

### Validator Testing

* #### HTML
    * No errors or warnings returned when passing through the official W3C validator.

* #### CSS 
    * No errors or warnings returned when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.

* #### Javascript
    * There were 34 warnings when testing code through the JSHint validator. 33 of them where "const/let/arrowfunction is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)." and 1 warning was 
    "198 [number] is better written in dot notation." No corrections were made.
